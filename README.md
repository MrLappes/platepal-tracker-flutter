## Development

### Code Organization
- **Models**: Define data structures using Dart classes with JSON serialization
- **Providers**: Manage application state using the Provider pattern
- **Services**: Handle business logic, API calls, and data processing
- **Components**: Build reusable UI components following Material Design principles
- **Screens**: Implement full-screen views with proper navigation handling

### State Management
This project uses the **Provider** pattern for state management:
- `MealProvider`: Manages meal logging and dish data
- `LocaleProvider`: Handles language and localization settings
- Additional providers for user profile, settings, and chat functionality

### Localization
The app supports multiple languages using Flutter's built-in internationalization:
- ARB files located in `lib/l10n/`
- Generated localization code in `.dart_tool/flutter_gen/gen_l10n/`
- Language switching available in settings

### Navigation
Uses **GoRouter** for declarative routing:
- Type-safe navigation
- Deep linking support
- Nested routing for complex navigation structures

## Configuration

### API Keys
For full functionality, you'll need to configure API keys:

1. **OpenAI API Key** (for AI chat features)
   - Get your API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Add to your app's settings or environment configuration

2. **Open Food Facts API** (for barcode scanning)
   - Free API for food product information
   - No API key required for basic usage
   - Website: [Open Food Facts](https://de.openfoodfacts.org/)

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project root (not included in version control):
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run tests with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Run specific test file
flutter test test/models/dish_test.dart
```

### Test Structure
- **Unit Tests**: Test business logic and data models
- **Widget Tests**: Test UI components in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete user workflows
